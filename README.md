# culture

A package that gets a random name from the Culture series' ships Minds.

## Getting started

This project requires Go to be installed. On OS X with Homebrew you can just run `brew install go`.

Running it then should be as simple as:

```console
$ go run main.go
```

### Testing

Once the API is running:

```console
$ curl http://localhost:8089/return-culture-ship-name
```
